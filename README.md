## Python library for assessing and visualizing dynamic wood material flows

> ℹ️ _This library is under continuous development_

This is a Python library that facilitates the assessment of wood materials flows, associated carbon stocks, and stock changes, as well as and their visualization over time. `aiphoria` builds on top of [ODYM - Open Dynamic Material Systems Model](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM).

## Features:
`aiphoria` allows you to:

- **Solve flows** provided both in absolute and relative (%) values, for example semi-finished wood product statistics (absolute values) to end-uses (relative values)
- **Conduct dynamic MFA as well as temporary carbon storage assessment**
- **Visualize material flows** through a Sankey diagram and provided timestep.

## Use cases:
`aiphoria` is ideal for:
- **Any temporal and spatial situation where material systems want to be assessed**
- **Product sink/stock effects**

## Documentation
Online documentation can be found in [wiki](https://github.com/EuropeanForestInstitute/aiphoria/wiki).
